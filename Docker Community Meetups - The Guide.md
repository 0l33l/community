#1. Docker Meetup Group Definition 

Docker Meetups are social events organized by community members who are interested in talking and learning about the Docker projects. Anyone can start a Docker Meetup group as long as there is not an existing Docker user group in your city. We simply ask our organizers to comply with our Code of Conduct and ensure everyone in the community feels welcome! Docker Community Managers are a resource for you to help start and foster a healthy community.
Docker Meetup events are usually 2-3 hours long, start between 4pm and 7pm and feature 1 to 3 main talks lasting 20-30 minutes each. This agenda can be adjusted to accommodate 10-minute lightning talks. The program can include introductory content, advanced technical deep dives, use cases, how-to tutorials, trainings, panels, or simply be social gatherings to discuss Docker projects.

#2. Launching a Docker Meetup Group 

There are few simple steps we suggest to successfully launch a Docker Meetup group:
First, check out the [Docker community page](https://www.docker.com/community/meetup-groups) to make sure a group does not already exist in your region.
Next, email us at meetup@docker.com to tell us in which city you wish to launch a Docker group. Let us know where you plan to host your first Docker meetup and/or if we can help you find a venue. Let us know if you have any sponsors or speakers in mind so we can share resources.
Once the group is launched, we recommend scheduling the first meetup with enough lead time for successful promotion. 
 
#3. Finding a Venue 

#### Find a venue: 
Message members in the group to see if they know of any companies that might be willing to offer office space for the meetup. Since meetups occur after traditional business hours, this request should not interfere with business activities.
Research where other local developer groups (such as Python, Ruby or Golang user Groups) hold meetups.
Reach out to companies in the Docker ecosystem that have offices in your local area.

#### Selecting a venue:
Make sure the venue is centrally located and that parking is readily available if you anticipate participants to travel by car or bike. The building should also be handicap accessible.
Consider the size of the room and design. Does it complement the format of event you want to host? Is there an adequate number of chairs? A room can also be too big. If you only expect 20 people, avoid booking a room that can hold 100 as it will feel empty.
Does the building have security? If so, what is the check in procedure? What information do they require in advance?
Is the hosting venue willing to sponsor food and beverage? It's also a great help if they can coordinate ordering and deliveries, but always offer to assist since they are already being gracious.
What audio/visual equipment is available at the venue? Do they have a microphone, projector/Apple TV available for presentations?

When in doubt, feel free to reach out to Victor Coisne (victor@docker.com)

#4. Finding Speakers

Message members in the group to see if they would like to present or if they know of any speakers from their network.
Is there anyone from the Docker Team in the local area who could give a talk?
Find local developer conferences, review the speaker list, and identify if anyone could be using Docker. Conferences can be tracked on lanyrd.com.
If members feel that a full presentation with slides is too much of a time commitment, a shorter lightning talk of 5-10 minutes or a quick demo is also great! Everyone can learn something from each other.
Tip in selecting appropriate speakers: talks should not be a sales pitch, but can however showcase a company’s tech and how it uses Docker. We also don’t expect speakers to “oversell” Docker. They should “be themselves” and formulate a talk they feel would be relevant to Docker users.

Don’t hesitate to ask Docker community managers for advice!

#5. Scheduling Meetups

#### Choosing a Date (prevent overlap)
Having a regular meetup date is key to an active group.Consistent meetups are essential in building a thriving community. Is there a certain time that works best for everyone? How often will you meet? No matter what your group decides, allowing enough time to travel to the meetup location and holding frequent, regular meetup events are two significant catalysts for a strong and active meetup group.

#### When to meet:
Outside of typical business hours - evenings tend to work best for most groups.
Weekdays like Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday work best: meeting during the workweek gives your group its best chance for a higher turnout (especially in North America and Europe).
Note that in Asia, meetups scheduled during the weekend also tend to be very well attended. 

When considering the date for your meetup, conduct a thorough search of other meetup groups in your local area that Docker users may already be attending. Consider, for example, when the Go or DevOps user groups meet and try to avoid scheduling your meetup events on coinciding days. You don’t want to force your attendees to choose between events - they (yourself included) may want to attend both!
 
Are holidays coming up or conferences happening close by that your members might attend? Consider scheduling the meetup so that both you and your members can participate in the event, or better yet, create a complementary meetup around the conference dates. Being flexible helps both you and the group maximize the time you have together.

Unsure about dates and times? Poll the group!

#### Event Description

Once you’re ready to post the meetup, providing enough information about the program is conducive to higher attendance. Haven’t finalized all of the details? Don’t worry - post the meetup anyway so it is on everyone’s radar. Update your post as details come. Just note if there are significant changes to the event (like cancelling a speaker); they may be infrequent, but it can affect turnout. 

Post the agenda if you have one. List start and end times, what time the presenter will speak, as well as any other details to let attendees know what to expect. Does the presenter have a biography and photo to share? What’s their Twitter or GitHub account? How about a brief abstract and/or talk title? Let your group get to know both the speaker and topic(s). 

Are there any venue-specific instructions attendees should know? Add some helpful tips about the meeting location and what to do once there, so getting to the meetup is as easy as possible.

Here is a [good example of a good meetup description] (http://www.meetup.com/Docker-meetups/events/226172627/) you may want to use as a starting template.

#### Food and Drink

Food - Consider options that are easy to eat and require minimal utensil usage. You want attendees to network and socialize easily without worrying about how to eat their food. Most groups opt for pizza, but variety is appreciated. They also don’t want to make a mess and you probably don’t want to stay late cleaning up after them. It’s also a good idea to provide options for those with different diets, such as: vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, Kosher, etc. No hungry engineers here!

Drinks - Many groups choose to offer alcohol, while many others choose not to - it is up to you. Be sure to follow and respect the venue’s rules around alcohol consumption on their premises - you want to be invited back! Provide drink alternatives, including and especially water. Don’t forget to watch out for the openly inebriated! You want your members to feel safe and return without the memory of a bad experience.

If your group is able to secure a sponsorship, be sure to list the sponsor in the event announcement and thank them before presentations. Let your group know if food and drinks will be provided so attendees can plan their meals ahead of time.

#6. Promotion 

Docker community managers can help with promoting your event across Docker’s social media channels. Once your meetup page is created, we’ll add your group to the global map and include it in our meetup groups. 

Docker will tweet about your meetup events and include them in the events section on docker.com and in the Docker Weekly newsletter.

Encourage members to invite friends and colleagues to meetups! Messaging through meetup.com is an effective way to encourage more communication and activity among members. The more the merrier!

Join forces! You may consider joining forces with another complementary meetup group with shared interests and goals. For new groups - perhaps in more remote locations - cross-promotion can be a great way to kickstart and establish the group’s presence. You can create an event together and then share it with each group’s members to multiply attendance. This encourages and builds the community on both sides.

For more advice on how to promote your meetup, check out the official meetup.com promotion page.
