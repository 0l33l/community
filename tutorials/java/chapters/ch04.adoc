## Run a Docker Container

The first step in running any application on Docker is to run a container from an image. There are plenty of images available from the official Docker registry (aka https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub]). To run any of them, you just have to ask the Docker Client to run it. The client will check if the image already exists on Docker Host. If it exists then it'll run it, otherwise the host will download the image and then run it.

### Pull Image

Let's first check, if any images are available:

[source, text]
----
docker images
----

At first, this list is empty. Now, let's get a vanilla `tomee` image:

[source, text]
----
docker pull tomee:8-jre-1.7.2-plus
----

By default, docker images are retrieved from https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub].

You can see, that Docker is downloading the image with it's different layers.

[NOTE]
====
In a traditional Linux boot, the Kernel first mounts the root File System as read-only, checks its integrity, and then switches the whole rootfs volume to read-write mode.
When Docker mounts the rootfs, it starts read-only, as in a traditional Linux boot, but then, instead of changing the file system to read-write mode, it takes advantage of a union mount to add a read-write file system over the read-only file system. In fact there may be multiple read-only file systems stacked on top of each other. Consider each one of these file systems as a layer.

At first, the top read-write layer has nothing in it, but any time a process creates a file, this happens in the top layer. And if something needs to update an existing file in a lower layer, then the file gets copied to the upper layer and changes go into the copy. The version of the file on the lower layer cannot be seen by the applications anymore, but it is there, unchanged.

We call the union of the read-write layer and all the read-only layers a _union file system_.
====

In our particular case, the https://github.com/tomitribe/docker-tomee/blob/master/8-jre-1.7.2-plus/Dockerfile[tomee:8-jre-1.7.2-plus] image extends the https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/blob/2dd0496901a9c01c78895d0e6618b36c08f78bde/openjdk-8-jre/Dockerfile[java:8-jre] image which adds the OpenJDK 8 JRE on top of the https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps/[buildpack] image.

When the download is done, you can list the images again using the `docker images` command and will see the following output:

### Run Container

#### Interactive Container

Run TomEE container in an interactive mode.

[source, text]
----
docker run -it tomee:8-jre-1.7.2-plus
----

This will show the output as:

[source, text]
----
Using CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/local/tomee
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/local/tomee
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /usr/local/tomee/temp
Using JRE_HOME:        /usr
Using CLASSPATH:       /usr/local/tomee/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/local/tomee/bin/tomcat-juli.jar

. . .

Mar 10, 2016 10:45:32 PM org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol start
INFO: Starting ProtocolHandler ["ajp-bio-8009"]
Mar 10, 2016 10:45:32 PM org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina start
INFO: Server startup in 1664 ms
----

This shows that the server started correctly, congratulations!

By default, Docker runs in the foreground. `-i` allows to interact with the STDIN and `-t` attach a TTY to the process. Switches can be combined together and used as `-it`.

Hit Ctrl+C to stop the container.

#### Detached Container

Restart the container in detached mode:

[source, text]
----
docker run -d tomee:8-jre-1.7.2-plus
827d56aa25855d7187a889b6672ec9632e85f0fecf45377eca438cb74d5aec40
----

`-d`, instead of `-it`, runs the container in detached mode.

The output is the unique id assigned to the container. Check the logs using `docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>` command. `<CONTAINER_ID>` is the id of the container.

We can check the status of the container by `docker ps` command:

[source, text]
----
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
827d56aa2585        tomee:8-jre-1.7.2-plus   "catalina.sh run"   37 seconds ago      Up 37 seconds       8080/tcp            nostalgic_shockley
----

Also try `docker ps -a` to see all the containers on this machine.

### Run Container with Default Port

Startup log of the server shows that the server is located in the `/usr/local/glassfish4/glassfish` directory. It also shows that the public interfaces are bound to the `0.0.0.0` address.

`docker-machine ip <machine-name>` gives us the Docker Host IP address and this was already added to the hosts file. So, we can give it another try by accessing: http://dockerhost:8080. However, this will not work either.

If you want containers to accept incoming connections, you will need to provide special options when invoking `docker run`. The container, we just started, can't be accessed by our browser. We need to stop it again and restart with different options.

[source, text]
----
docker stop `docker ps | grep tomee | awk '{print $1}'`
----

Restart the container as:

[source, text]
----
docker run -d -P tomee:8-jre-1.7.2-plus
----

`-P` map any exposed ports inside the image to a random port on Docker host. This can be verified using `docker ps` command:

[source, text]
----
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                     NAMES
0ded29c1d14d        tomee:8-jre-1.7.2-plus   "catalina.sh run"   9 seconds ago       Up 8 seconds        0.0.0.0:32786->8080/tcp   naughty_swanson
----

The port mapping is shown in the `PORTS` column. Access the GlassFish server at http://dockerhost:32786. Make sure to use the correct port number as shown in your case.

NOTE: Exact port number may be different in your case.

The page would look like:

image::tomee-first-run-default-page.png[]

### Run Container with Specified Port

Lets stop the previously running container as:

[source, text]
----
docker stop `docker ps | grep tomee | awk '{print $1}'`
----

Restart the container as:

[source, text]
----
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 tomee:8-jre-1.7.2-plus
----

The format is `-p hostPort:containerPort`. This option maps container ports to host ports and allows other containers on our host to access them.

Now we're ready to test http://dockerhost:8080 again. This works with the exposed port, as expected.

### Deploy a WAR file to Application Server

Now that your application server is running, lets see how to deploy a WAR file to it.

Use the following Dockerfile in a new directory:

[source, text]
----
FROM tomee:8-jre-7.0.0-M2-plus

RUN curl -L https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-simple-sample/releases/download/v1.10/javaee7-simple-sample-1.10.war -o /usr/local/tomee/webapps/javaee-simple-sample.war
----

Create an image:

[source, text]
----
docker build -t javaee-sample .
----

Start the container:

[source, text]
----
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 javaee-sample
----

Access the endpoint:

[source, text]
----
curl http://192.168.99.100:8080/javaee7-simple-sample/resources/persons | xml-fmt
----

See the output:

[source, text]
----
<persons>
	<person>
		<name>
		Penny
		</name>
	</person>
	<person>
		<name>
		Leonard
		</name>
	</person>
	<person>
		<name>
		Sheldon
		</name>
	</person>
	<person>
		<name>
		Amy
		</name>
	</person>
	<person>
		<name>
		Howard
		</name>
	</person>
	<person>
		<name>
		Bernadette
		</name>
	</person>
	<person>
		<name>
		Raj
		</name>
	</person>
	<person>
		<name>
		Priya
		</name>
	</person>
</persons>
----

### Stop Container

Stop a specific container:

[source, text]
----
docker stop <CONTAINER ID>
----

Stop all the running containers

[source, text]
----
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
----

Stop only the exited containers

[source, text]
----
docker ps -a -f "exited=-1"
----

### Remove Container

Remove a specific container:

[source, text]
----
docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>
----

Remove containers meeting a regular expression

[source, text]
----
docker ps -a | grep tomee | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm
----

Remove all containers, without any criteria

[source, text]
----
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
----

##### Additional Ways To Find Port Mapping

The exact mapped port can also be found using `docker port` command:

[source, text]
----
docker port <CONTAINER_ID>
----

This shows the output as:

[source, text]
----
8080/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32786
----

Port mapping can be also be found using `docker inspect` command:

[source, text]
----
docker inspect --format='{{(index (index .NetworkSettings.Ports "8080/tcp") 0).HostPort}}' <CONTAINER ID>
----
