== Setup Environments

This section describes the software needed for this workshop. This workshop is designed for a BYOL (Brying Your Own Laptop) style hands-on-lab.

=== Hardware

. Operating System: Mac OS X (10.8+), Windows 7+, Ubuntu 12+, CentOS 7+, Fedora 21+
. Memory: At least 4 GB+, preferred 8 GB

=== Docker Toolbox or Packages

Docker runs natively on Linux. Because the Docker daemon uses Linux-specific kernel features, you canâ€™t run Docker natively in OS X or Windows. Instead, you must use `docker-machine` to create and attach to a virtual machine (VM). This machine is a Linux VM that hosts Docker for you on your Mac or Windows.

Follow the instructions to install Docker:

. https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox[Docker Toolbox for Mac or Windows]
. http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ubuntulinux/[Docker on Ubuntu]
. http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/centos/[Docker on Centos]
. http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/fedora/[Docker on Fedora]

Complete set of operating systems are listed at http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Install Docker Engine].

=== Create Docker Host Mapping

To make it easier to start/stop the containers, an entry is added into the host mapping table of your operating system. Find out the IP address of your machine:

```console
docker-machine ip default
```

This will provide the IP address associated with the Docker Machine created earlier.

For Linux machine, Docker host is running on local machine and so the IP address would be `127.0.0.1`.

Edit `/etc/hosts` (Mac OS or Linux) or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (Windows) and add:

[source, text]
----
<IP ADDRESS>  dockerhost
----
