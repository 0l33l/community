Docker Meetup Genius Program

The goal is to build a tool that would allow Docker meetup organizers to:
- Identify overlapping group members for each city to decide when they should schedule the next meetup or which group they should join forces with
- Load RSVPs for each event to build a predictive model to tell us which members are still active 
- Identify venues / companies that usually host meetups in each city and which one would be the best fit for the estimated number of attendees
